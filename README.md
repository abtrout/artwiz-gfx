# Artwiz GFX fonts

Artwiz fonts ported for use with any [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)-compatible display. Most of the `artwiz-aleczapka` PCF fonts were converted to BDF with `pcf2bdf` and then to GFX with [`bdf_to_gfx.py`](/bdf_to_gfx.py). You can probably use the same process for other PCF/BDF fonts.

Check out the [demo sketch](demo/demo.ino) for example usage.
